<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">The Customs and Traditions Of The Maheshwari Community
There is a need shown for the Indian sages and religious matters and aesthetic culture.For them there are some remedies and inventions whose impression not only falls on the body and mind but also on the soul.These remedies are the ‘Aesthetic Values’ by which man becomes human and more civilized.If a person has no aesthetic values ,he is uncultured.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">Science has also approved of this importanceof aesthetic value or culture.The culture of the whole world takes the man away from Sin and Ignorance and joins him to thoughtfulness and knowledge so that the man can lead a governed life.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">Just like how by using different colours which are appropriate to make a picture beautiful,attractive and full of reality, in the same way a good culture makes a man feelsensible in his mind and is loved by all, he also feels happy and at peace.In every religion there is a positive culture , as in Hindu religion there is a type of a culture , in the same way there is a certain number which is fixed in the Hindu religion</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;"><b>Saint Shai Vyas has found Main Shidas(sixteen) cultures which are followed.They are:</b></p>
<ol style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">
	<li>Garbadhan</li>    <li>Prasavan</li>    <li>Simantoyan</li>    <li>Jatkarma</li>    <li>Namkaran</li>

    <li>Sanyaashram</li>    <li>Anthyeshtsanskar</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">If we describe these cultures in todays age then we find that the age and the physical body, the needs of the physical body are kept in mind while writing the culture in series.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;"><b>The main three cultures are:-</b>
1. Birth
2. Marriage
3. Death</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">In this the society is very much involved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">Below there is given the customs and traditions of the society , so that we can understand the similarity and the opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">Birth Culture</p>

<h4 style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">1.God Bharna : We can also call it Khol Bharna</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">When a woman is pregnant in the seventh or nineth month , this custom is performed , but this is never done in the eighth month. Whatever materials are needed in this God Bharna are as follows :-
Coconut , Jaggery , Bijounra , Nimbu , Seven fruits with flour and other fruits (no bananas) . These materials come from woman’s maternal house. With this also comes clothes and money according to the choice of son-in-law , mother-in-law and father-in-law.The God Bharna is done only by a lady whose all children are alive, has had no miscarriage or abortions , and also whose first child is a male child.Now first before the first thing the woman has to perform God Bharna to such a woman.Then all the material that has been brought that is Ghevar ,Laddoo , fruits , clothes are put in the lap of the woman. Then the lady who is pregnant or the other ladies of the family or relatives who are present at this time go to the temple for darshan.According to the status relatives go to the temple for lunch. During this lunch the maternal side people offer the inlaws food first. So they send the pregnant woman in the seventh or the nineth month(leaving the eighth month) to her mothers house. During the eighth month pregnant ladies do not cross any lake , rivers . There is even a custom of performing puja of the entrance of the house of the mother of the pregnant lady.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">The main importance of this puja is the importance of Vaastu Shastra . The materials that we need for this puja is leaf(of betel) , jaggery , kumkum , rice , supari , dub , motichoor laddoo . On the entrance of the door one rupee twenty five paise coin and after the gobar pujan they put laddoo on the entrance , which is then just rolled inside the house with the hand.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">We do this when the baby is born , a Jatkarma culture is performed , when we sing Nal Geet . After this the baby is given a small gold bar or a small ring in the ring finger . The baby is given a little honey to lick . This is doing the end to gold tridosh , as honey is a good remedy on cough for the baby . The mixture of these three Vayu , Lavanya and Megha Shakti are very pure and increases strength. We cannot do this always which we should. After this the mothers breasts are washed and the baby is breast fed.This is done by mother’s sister or sister-in-law. Now the clothes are worn by the person who is the head of the family, if the clothes are old then wash them and wear them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">After hearing the birth of a male baby or a son the mother’s house people and the inlaws play music on a plate with a spoon. Now a days they play music also and tie Vandanava by the barber.</p>
